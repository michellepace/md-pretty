I'm developing a React web app with TypeScript and need a markdown editor library with live preview functionality.
</context>

<requirements>
<functionality priority="highest">
* Live preview that supports GitHub-flavoured markdown styling
* Split pane view (editor/preview side by side)
* Support for core markdown syntax including: Code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Nice to have: Synchronized scrolling between editor and preview
</functionality>

<design>
* Clean, minimal UI suitable for professional applications
* Fully responsive design that works well on mobile devices (critical)
* Customizable/minimal toolbar with basic formatting options
</design>

<technical>
* Compatible with Tailwind CSS 3 for styling
* Strong TypeScript support with type definitions
* Lightweight with good performance
* Popular enough to be recognised by Claude 3.7 Sonnet and other LLMs
* Well-documented
</technical>
</requirements>

<instructions>
Please provide:
1. A comparison of 3 strong options with a table showing how each performs against my requirements
2. Make a single clear recommendation with specific reasoning tied to my requirements
3. If relevant, mention any alternatives I should consider if my requirements change.
