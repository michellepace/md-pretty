I've attached two files:
1. "tailwind-refactor-goal.md" - Contains our refactoring goals and Tailwind best practices
2. An html file - The HTML file containing Tailwind CSS 3 code that needs refactoring

Please review the html file against the best practices outlined in the refactoring document and create a step-by-step refactoring plan with the following:

1. A brief assessment of the current code, noting major issues that need addressing
2. A numbered list of discrete refactoring steps in logical order
3. For each step, include:
   - The specific goal of this step
   - What types of changes will be made
   - How this step moves us toward our ultimate goal

Please determine the most logical sequence for these steps based on the specific code patterns you see in home.html rather than following a predetermined order.

After you provide this plan, we'll implement each step one by one, starting with step 1.
